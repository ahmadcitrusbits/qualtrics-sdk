We have been looking into the SDK & tried multiple versions of react-native-qualtrics and Qualtrics pods but we are still getting the crash on iOS. For now, with the latest react-native versions we only have tested it on iOS.

We tried the following different versions, <br>
react-native 0.71.3 <br>
react-native-qualtrics 2.4.1, 2.3.0, 2.2.0, <br>
Qualtrics pods  2.9.1,  2.9.0,  2.4.0,  2.1.0, <br>
hermes_enabled true/false

Error logs:
